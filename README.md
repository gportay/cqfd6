# What are cqfd and cqfd6 ?

cqfd provides a quick and convenient way to run commands in the current
directory, but within a Docker container defined in a per-project config
file.

This becomes useful when building an application designed for another
Linux system, e.g. building an old embedded firmware that only works
in an older Linux distribution.

cqfd uses containers and introduced the concept of build containers to define a
container specifically configured with all the software required to build the
project. Simply install the necessary packages in the container file, and cqfd
makes you feel at home by adding your user and mounting your project workspace
into the build container. In short, cqfd makes it easy to build the image and
execute commands in a fresh container, with only a few lightweight, per-project
static configuration files. As the cherry on top, cqfd can also build the
project for different architectures thanks to multi-platform images and
emulation.

cqfd6 is a fork of cqfd fixing several broken things in the upstream project.
It depreciates the former CLI to modernize it to something much more simple and
much more common such as the CLI of `sudo`. Moreover, the project need a new
name, remembering its roots.

# Using cqfd

## Getting started

Just follow these steps:

* [Install cqfd](#installingremoving-cqfd6)
* Make sure your user is a member of the `docker` group
* Go into your project's directory
* Create a `.cqfdrc` file
* Create a Dockerfile and save it as `.cqfd/docker/Dockerfile`
* Run `cqfd init`

Examples are available in the `samples/` directory.

`cqfd` will use the provided Dockerfile to create a normalized runtime
build environment for your project.

> ⚠️ Warning
>
> Running `cqfd init` creates and names a new Docker image each
> time the Dockerfile is modified, which may lead to a large number of
> unused images that are not automatically purged.

## Using cqfd on a daily basis

### Regular builds

To build your project from the configured build environment with the
default build command as configured in `.cqfdrc`, use:

    $ cqfd

Alternatively, you may want to specify a single custom command to be
executed from inside the build container.

    $ cqfd exec make clean

Or custom commands composed with shell grammar:

    $ cqfd shell -c "make linux-dirclean && make foobar-dirclean"

Or run a shell script with arguments:

    $ cqfd shell ./build.sh debug

When `cqfd` is running, the current directory is mounted by Docker
as a volume. As a result, all the build artefacts generated inside the
container are still accessible in this directory after the container
has been stopped and removed.

### Release

The `--release` option creates a release tarball for your project. The release
files (as specified in your `.cqfdrc`) will be included inside the release
archive.

    $ cqfd --release

The resulting release file is then called according to the archive
template, which defaults to `%Po-%Pn.tar.xz`.

### Flavors

Flavors are used to create alternate build scenarios. For example, to
use another container or another build command.

## The .cqfdrc file

The `.cqfdrc` file at the root of your project contains the information
required to support project tooling. It is written in an .ini-like
format and `samples/dot-cqfdrc` is an example.

Here is a sample `.cqfdrc` file:

    [project]
    org='fooinc'
    name='buildroot'

    [build]
    command='make foobar_defconfig && make && asciidoc README.FOOINC'
    files='README.FOOINC output/images/sdcard.img'
    archive='cqfd-%Gh.tar.xz'

### Comments

The `.cqfdrc` file supports Unix shell comments; the words after the character `#`
are ignored up to the end of line. A comment cannot be set in the first line,
and right after a section.

### The [project] section

`org`: a short, lowercase name for the project’s parent organization.

`name`: a short, lowercase name for the project.

`build_context` (optional): a directory to pass as the build context
to Docker. This should be specified relatively to where `cqfd` is
invoked.  For example, it can be set to `.`, to use the current
working directory of the invoked `cqfd` command as the Docker build
context, which can be useful when files at the root of the project are
required to build the image.  When using this option, a
`.dockerignore` file can be useful to limit what gets sent to the
Docker daemon.

`custom_img_name` (optional): allows specifying a custom Docker image name
instead of the one automatically generated by cqfd. You can also include a
private repository URL in the image name. If you do, cqfd will try to pull the
image from the provided repository, if not already available on your system.
`custom_img_name` is *deprecated*, use either `tag` to name your image or
`image` to pull an image from a registry.

`tag` (optional): allows specifying a Docker image name to use instead
of the one automatically generated by cqfd. By default, cqfd uses
`%Po_%Pn_%Bd`.
You can include environment variable names, as well as the following
template marks:
* `%Un` - user name
* `%Po` - value of the `project.org` configuration key
* `%Pn` - value of the `project.name` configuration key
* `%Dh` - short hash of Dockerfile
* `%DH` - long hash of Dockerfile
* `%Bd` - value of the `build.distro` configuration key

For example, to use dashes instead of underscores, it can be set like:

```
tag=%Po-%Pn-%Bd
```

`image` (optional): allows specifying a Docker image to pull from a
registry. For example, to use Ubuntu 16.04, it can be set like:

```
image=ubuntu:16:04
```

Note: When using a prebuilt image from a repository using `custom_img_name` or
`image`, the `cqfd init` is **not** necessary as no image has to be built.
Furthermore, when using `image` the `Dockerfile` is **not** necessary as well.

### The [build] section

#### `cqfd`

`command`: the command string to be executed when cqfd is invoked. This
string will be passed as an argument to a classical `sh -c "commands"`,
within the build container, to generate the build artefacts.

`distro` (optional): the name of the directory containing the Dockerfile. By
default, cqfd uses `"docker"`, and `.cqfd/docker/Dockerfile` is used.
`distro` is *deprecated*, use `dockerfile` to set the path to the `Dockerfile`.

`user_extra_groups` (optional): a space-separated list of groups the user
should be a member of in the container. You can either use the `group:gid`
format, or simply specify the `group` name if it exists either in the host or
inside the docker image.

`flavors` (optional): the list of build flavors (see below). Each flavor has
its own command just like `build.command`. This property is now automatically
deduced from the flavors sections of `.cqfdrc`.

`dockerfile` (optional): the path to the `Dockerfile`. The path is relative to
the project directory (i.e. the parent directory of `.cqfd`). By default, cqfd
uses `.cqfd/$distro/Dockerfile` with `distro=docker` if `distro` is unset. For
example, to use existing `Dockerfile`, it can be set like:
```
dockerfile='support/docker/Dockerfile'
```

`docker_build_args` (optional): arguments used to invoke `docker build`.
For example, to attempt to pull newer version of the image, it can be set like:
```
docker_build_args='--pull=true'
```

`docker_pull_args` (optional): arguments used to invoke `docker pull`.
For example, to not skip image verification, it can be set like:
```
docker_pull_args='--disable-content-trust=false'
```

`docker_run_args` (optional): arguments used to invoke `docker run`.
For example, to share networking with the host, it can be set like:
```
docker_run_args='--network=host'
```

#### `cqfd --release`

`files`: the space-separated list of files generated by the build process
that we want to include inside a standard release archive.

`archive` (optional): the name of the release archive generated by cqfd. You
can include environment variable names, as well as the following template
marks:

* `%Gh` - git short hash of last commit
* `%GH` - git long hash of last commit
* `%D3` - RFC3339 date (YYYY-MM-DD)
* `%Du` - Unix timestamp
* `%Cf` - current cqfd flavor name (if any)
* `%Po` - value of the `project.org` configuration key
* `%Pn` - value of the `project.name` configuration key
* `%%` - a litteral '%' sign

By default, cqfd will generate a release archive named
`org-name.tar.xz`, where 'org' and 'name' come from the project's
configuration keys. The .tar.xz, .tar.gz and .zip archive formats are
supported.

For tar archives:

* Setting `tar_transform=yes` (optional) will cause all files specified for
  the archive to be stored at the root of the archive, which is desired in some
  scenarios.

* Setting `tar_options` (optional) will pass extra options to the tar
  command. For example, setting `tar_options=-h` will copy all symlink files
  as hardlinks, which is desired in some scenarios.

### Using build flavors

In some cases, it may be desirable to build the project using
variations of the build and release methods (for example a debug
build). This is made possible in cqfd with the build flavors feature.

In the `.cqfdrc` file, one or more flavors may be listed in the
`[build]` section, referencing other sections named following
flavor's name.

    [centos7]
    command='make CENTOS=1'
    distro='centos7'

    [debug]
    command='make DEBUG=1'
    files='myprogram Symbols.map'

    [build]
    command='make'
    files='myprogram'

A flavor will typically redefine some keys of the build section:
command, files, archive, distro.

Flavors from a `.cqfdrc` file can be listed using the `flavors` argument.

### Environment variables

The following environment variables are supported by cqfd to provide
the user with extra flexibility during his day-to-day development
tasks:

`CQFD_WORKDIR`: directory used as working directory (default parent of
`.cqfd`).

`CQFD_DIR`: directory used as cqfd directory (default `.cqfd`).

`CQFDRC_FILE`: file as config file (default `.cqfdrc`).

`CQFD_DOCKER`: program used to invoke `docker` client.
For example, to use podman, it can be set like:
```
CQFD_DOCKER='podman' cqfd
```

`CQFD_EXTRA_RUN_ARGS`: A space-separated list of additional
docker-run options to be append to the starting container.
Format is the same as (and passed to) docker-run’s options.
See 'docker run --help'.

`CQFD_EXTRA_BUILD_ARGS`: A space-separated list of additional
docker-build options to be append to the building image.
Format is the same as (and passed to) docker-build’s options.
See 'docker build --help'.

`CQFD_EXTRA_PULL_ARGS`: A space-separated list of additional
docker-pull options to be append to the pulled image.
Format is the same as (and passed to) docker-pull’s options.
See 'docker pull --help'.

`CQFD_EXTRA_RMI_ARGS`: A space-separated list of additional
docker-rmi options to be append to the removed image.
Format is the same as (and passed to) docker-rmi’s options.
See 'docker rmi --help'.

`CQFD_NO_SSH_CONFIG`: Set to `true` to disable forwarding the global
`/etc/ssh` configurations to the container. This may be required if
the host's `ssh` configuration is not compatible with the `ssh`
version within the container.

`CQFD_NO_USER_SSH_CONFIG`: Set to `true` to disable forwarding
the user's `~/.ssh` configuration to the container.

`CQFD_NO_USER_GIT_CONFIG`: Set to `true` to disable forwarding
the user's `~/.gitconfig` configuration to the container.

`CQFD_NO_SSH_AUTH_SOCK`: Set to `true` to disable forwarding the
SSH authentication socket to the container.

`CQFD_BIND_DOCKER_SOCK`: Set to `true` to enable forwarding the
docker socket to the container.

`CQFD_DOCKER_GID`: The gid of the docker group in host to map to
the cqfd group in the container.

`CQFD_RUN_WITH_SUDO`: Set to ``true`` to run `$CQFD_DOCKER` with
`sudo`.

`CQFD_SHELL`: The shell to be launched, by default `/bin/sh`.

### Appending to the build command

The `-c` option set immediately after the command run allows appending the
command of a cqfd run for temporary developments:

    $ cqfd -b centos7 run -c "clean"
    $ cqfd -b centos7 run -c "TRACING=1"

### Running a shell in the container

You can use the `shell` command to quickly pop a shell in your defined
container. The shell to be launched (default `/bin/sh`) can be customized using
the `CQFD_SHELL` environment variable.

Example:

    fred@host:~/project$ cqfd shell
    fred@container:~/project$

### Use cqfd as an interpreter for shell script

You can use the `shell` command to write a shell script and run it in your
defined container.

Example:

    fred@host:~/project$ cat get-container-pretty-name.sh
    #!/usr/bin/env -S cqfd shell
    if ! test -e /.dockerenv; then
        exit 1
    fi
    source /etc/os-release
    echo "$PRETTY_NAME"
    fred@host:~/projet$ ./get-container-pretty-name.sh
    Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)

### Use cqfd as a standard shell for binaries

You can even use the `shell` command to use it as a standard `$SHELL` so
binaries honoring that variable run shell commands in your defined container.

Example:

    fred@host:~/project$ make SHELL="cqfd shell"
    Available make targets:
       help:      This help message
       install:   Install script, doc and resources
       uninstall: Remove script, doc and resources
       tests:     Run functional tests

### Multi-platform

Docker supports multi-platform images; such images can run on multiple
platforms (amd64, arm64, etc.). Therefore, cqfd takes advantage of this
to build and run containers for different architectures thanks to QEMU and
binfmt on Linux.

Example:

First, specify the desired platform in the `Dockerfile`, as shown below:

    FROM --platform=linux/arm64 ubuntu:24.04
    (...)

Then, initialize the image:

    $ cqfd init

Finally, test the build container:

    $ cqfd exec uname -m
    aarch64

Additionally, cqfd supports the option `--platform TARGET`, the environment
variable `CQFD_PLATFORM`, and the build property `platform=` to set the desired
platform dynamically.

Examples:

    $ cqfd --platform linux/arm64 init
    $ cqfd --platform linux/arm64 exec uname -m
    aarch64

    $ export CQFD_PLATFORM="linux/arm64"
    $ cqfd init
    $ cqfd exec uname -m
    aarch64

    $ cat .cqfdrc
    [project]
    org='fooinc'
    name='multi-platform'

    [arm64]
    platform='linux/arm64'

    [build]
    command='uname -a'
    $ cqfd init
    $ cqfd exec uname -m
    x86_64
    $ cqfd -b arm64 exec uname -m
    aarch64

### Key files and directories

cqfd project uses three key files and directories.

The `.cqfd` directory contains the `Dockerfile`s, organized in a specific
hierarchy. Each build container file is located and accessed according to the
`distro` build property: `.cqfd/$distro/Dockerfile`. This `.cqfd` directory is
controlled by the `-d` option or the `CQFD_DIR` environment variable.

The `.cqfd` directory mainly serves to locate the root of the cqfd project. The
root directory is the parent of the `.cqfd` directory, and it is referred to as
the *project* or *working* directory. This directory is bind-mounted into the
build container and is controlled by the `-w` option or the `CQFD_WORKDIR`
environment variable.

The `.cqfdrc` file defines the cqfd project information and the build command.
It is controlled by the `-f` option or the `CQFDRC_FILE` environment variable.

All these files and directories are interpreted relative to the current working
directory if specified with a relative path. Additionally, the `-C` option
changes the working directory, meaning that these files and directories are
then relative to the new working directory.

In some cases, you may want to use alternate cqfd filenames and/or an external
directory. The following options allow you to control cqfd configuration files:

To change the current working directory, use the `-C` option:

    $ cqfd -C external/directory

To specify an alternate cqfd directory, use the `-d` option:

    $ cqfd -d cqfd_alt

To specify an alternate cqfdrc file, use the `-f` option:

    $ cqfd -f cqfdrc_alt

To specify an alternate working directory, use the `-w` option:

    $ cqfd -w ..

These options can be combined, for example to use out-of-tree cqfd files if
these files cannot be commit to the project.

Example:

    ~/src$ tree out-of-tree-cqfd-files/
    out-of-tree-cqfd-files/
    ├── cqfd
    │   └── docker
    │       └── Dockerfile
    └── cqfdrc

    3 directories, 2 files
    ~/src$ cd buildroot
    ~/src/buildroot$ cqfd -w . -d ../out-of-tree-cqfd-files/cqfd -f ../out-of-tree-cqfd-files/cqfdrc
    # or sourcing enviroment from a file
    ~/src/buildroot$ cat environment
    export CQFD_WORKDIR=.
    export CQFD_DIR=../out-of-tree-cqfd-files/cqfd
    export CQFDRC_FILE=../out-of-tree-cqfd-files/cqfdrc
    ~/src/buildroot$ source environment
    ~/src/buildroot$ cqfd
    (...)

## Build Container Environment

When cqfd runs, a docker container is launched as the environment in
which to run the *command*.  Within this environment, commands are run
as the same user as the one invoking cqfd (with a fallback to the
'builder' user in case it cannot be determined). So that this user has
access to local files, the current working directory is mapped to
the same location inside the container.

### SSH Handling

The local ~/.ssh directory is also mapped to the corresponding
directory in the build container. This effectively enables SSH agent
forwarding so a build can, for example, pull authenticated git repos.

### Terminal job control

When cqfd runs a command as the unprivileged user that called it in
the first place, `su(1)` is used to run the command. This brings a
limitation for processes that require a controlling terminal (such as
an interactive shell), as `su` will prevent the command executed
from having one.

```
$ cqfd bash
bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
```

To work around this limitation, cqfd will use `sudo(8)` when it is
available in the container instead. The user is responsible for
including it in the related Dockerfile.

## Requirements

To use cqfd, ensure the following requirements are satisfied on your
workstation:

-  Bash

-  Docker

-  A `docker` group in your /etc/group

-  Your username is a member of the `docker` group

-  Restart your docker service if you needed to create the group.

variables:

    $ make install PREFIX=/opt
    $ make install PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=package

### Arch Linux or Manjaro

If you use an Arch Linux derivative distribution based on pacman package
manager, you can build the latest released version of the `cqfd6` package via:

```sh
makepkg
```

Or, the current unreleased version of the `cqfd6-git` package via:

```sh
makepkg -f PKGBUILD-git
```

_Note_: The artefacts are available in the current directory.

### Debian or Ubuntu

If you use an Debian derivative distribution based on the dpkg package manager,
you can build the latest released version of the `cqfd6` package via:

```sh
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc
```

_Note_: The artefacts are available in the parent directory.

### RedHat Linux or Fedora

If you use a RPM based distribution, you can build the latest released version
of the `cqfd6` package via:

```sh
rpmdev-setuptree
cp cqfd6.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/
cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
rpmbuild --undefine=_disable_source_fetch -ba cqfd6.spec "$@"

```

_Note_: The artefacts are available in `~/rpmbuild/RPMS` and `~/rpmbuild/SRPMS`
directories.

## Using podman

Podman may be used instead of Docker, but with limited functionalities,
for example when dealing with extra groups.

To use podman instead of docker, you can set in your environment,
like your `.bashrc`, `.profile` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
export CQFD_DOCKER="podman"
export PODMAN_USERNS="keep-id"
```

## Testing cqfd (for developers)

The codebase contains tests which can be invoked using the following
command, if the above requirements are met on the system:

    $ make tests

## The parser

The .ini parser is implemented using a series of bash substitutions that
transform an .ini-style configuration file into shell instructions. The
original code was written by Andrés J. Díaz and later improved and
simplified[1].

In practice, sections are converted into functions whose names are prefixed
with `cfg_section_`, while properties are translated into variables. The
resulting code is then evaluated with `eval`, and the section functions are
executed to set the corresponding properties in the shell environment.

For example:

``` .ini
# The content of .cqfdrc:
[project]
org=savoirfairelinux
name=cqfd

[build]
command=/bin/sh
```

``` sh
# The generated shell code
function cfg_section_project {
    org=savoirfairelinux
    name=cqfd
}

function cfg_section_build {
    command=/bin/sh
}
```

_Important_: Shell commands must not be placed inside sections; any code
present is executed upon section load.
