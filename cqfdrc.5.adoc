== NAME

cqfdrc - project information config file

== DESCRIPTION

The _.cqfdrc_ file at the root of your project contains the information
required to support project tooling. It is written in an .ini-like format.

=== COMMENT

The _.cqfdrc_ file supports Unix shell and .ini comments; the words after the
character _#_ or _;_ are ignored up to the end of line.

=== THE PROJECT SECTION

*org*::
	a short, lowercase name for the project’s parent organization.

*name*::
	a short, lowercase name for the project.

*flavors (optional)*::
	The list of build flavors (see below). Each flavor has its own command
	just like _build.command_. _flavors_ is *deprecated*, the flavors are
	now automatically deduced from the flavors sections of _.cqfdrc_.

*build_context (optional)*::
	a directory to pass as the build context to Docker. This should be
	specified relatively to where _cqfd6_ is invoked.  For example, it can
	be set to _._, to use the current working directory of the invoked
	_cqfd6_ command as the Docker build context, which can be useful when
	files at the root of the project are required to build the image. When
	using this option, a _.dockerignore_ file can be useful to limit what
	gets sent to the Docker daemon.

*custom_img_name (optional)*::
	allows specifying a custom Docker image name instead of the one
	automatically generated by _cqfd6_. You can also include a private
	repository URL in the image name. If you do, _cqfd6_ will try to pull
	the image from the provided repository, if not already available on
	your system.
	_custom_img_name_ is *deprecated*, use either _tag_ to name your image
	or _image_ to pull an image from a registry.

*tag (optional)*::
	allows specifying a Docker image name to use instead of the one
	automatically generated by _cqfd6_. By default, _cqfd6_ uses
	__%Po-%Pn-%Dp-%Bd__. The image name is still prefixed by __cqfd-%Un-__.
	You can include environment variable names, as well as the
	following template marks:
	* *%Un* - user name
	* *%Po* - value of the `project.org` configuration key
	* *%Pn* - value of the `project.name` configuration key
	* *%Dp* - image platform
	* *%Dh* - short hash of Dockerfile
	* *%DH* - long hash of Dockerfile
	* *%Bd* - value of the `build.distro` configuration key

*image (optional)*::
	allows specifying a Docker image to pull from a registry.

=== THE BUILD SECTION

==== CQFD RUN

*command*::
	The command string to be executed when _cqfd6_ is invoked. This string
	will be passed as an argument to a classical _sh -c "commands"_, within
	the build container, to generate the build artefacts.

*distro (optional)*::
	The name of the directory containing the Dockerfile. By default,
	_cqfd6_ uses _"docker"_, and _.cqfd/docker/Dockerfile_ is used.
	_distro_ is *deprecated*, use _dockerfile_ to set the path to the
	_Dockerfile_.

*user_extra_groups (optional)*::
	A space-separated list of groups the user should be a member of in the
	build container. You can either use the _group:gid_ format, or simply
	specify the _group_ name if it exists either in the host or inside the
	docker image.

*shell (optional)*::
	The program used to invoke _shell_ command.

*path (optional)*::
	Set the _PATH_ environment variable in the build container.

*docker (optional)*::
	The program used to invoke _docker(1)_ client.

*dockerfile (optional)*::
	The path to the _Dockerfile_. The path is relative to the project
	directory (i.e. the parent directory of _.cqfd_). By default, _cqfd6_
	uses _.cqfd/$distro/Dockerfile_ with _distro=docker_ if _distro_ is
	unset.

*docker_build_args (optional)*::
	A space-separated list of extra arguments used to invoke _docker
	build_.

*docker_pull_args (optional)*::
	A space-separated list of extra arguments used to invoke _docker
	pull_.

*docker_run_args (optional)*::
	A space-separated list of extra arguments used to invoke _docker run_.

*docker_rmi_args (optional)*::
	A space-separated list of extra arguments used to invoke _docker rmi_.

==== CQFD RELEASE

*files*::
	The space-separated list of files generated by the build process that
	we want to include inside a standard release archive.

*archive (optional)*::
	The name of the release archive generated by _cqfd6_. You can include
	environment variable names, as well as the following template marks:
	* *%Gh* - git short hash of last commit
	* *%GH* - git long hash of last commit
	* *%D3* - RFC3339 date (YYYY-MM-DD)
	* *%Du* - Unix timestamp
	* *%Cf* - current cqfd flavor name (if any)
	* *%Po* - value of the project.org configuration key
	* *%Pn* - value of the project.name configuration key
	* *%%* - a litteral '%' sign

By default, _cqfd6_ will generate a release archive named _org-name.tar.xz_,
where _org_ and _name_ come from the project's configuration keys. The .tar.xz,
.tar.gz and .zip archive formats are supported.

For tar archives:

* Setting _tar_transform=yes_ (optional) will cause all files specified for
  the archive to be stored at the root of the archive, which is desired in some
  scenarios.

* Setting _tar_options_ (optional) will pass extra options to the tar
  command. For example, setting _tar_options=-h_ will copy all symlink files as
  hardlinks, which is desired in some scenarios.
